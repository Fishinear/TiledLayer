#TiledLayer

## Description
`TiledLayer` is a replacement for iOS `CATiledLayer`, with many extra features:

- different scaling factors for x and y directions
- choose your own scaling steps (instead of only x2)
- any layout of tiles possible
- non-square tiles, different size tiles in one layer
- match the scaling factor to the native resolution of your tiles
- set a margin to load tiles just outside of the visible ones
- you get notified when a tile is no longer needed
- allow 'crisp' tiles: create tiles that have the same resolution as the screen

## Usage

The tiles are actually objects: they must be, or derive from the `Tile` class,
which is itself a `CALayer`. You create a class implementing the
`TileProvider` interface and register that with the `TiledLayer`. This
`TileProvider` is called by the `TiledLayer` every time a new tile is needed.
The `TileProvider` has full control over how the tiling is done, how big
the tiles are, what their native scale is, etc. The `TiledLayer` simply says
"give me a tile that covers this point in the world".
And it will keep requesting tiles like that until the visible area is
filled.

There is also a `StandardTileProvider` that uses zoom scales with a factor two.

The header files have more documentation.

A small `ViewController` class is included that shows a basic way of using
the classes. In that one, the background of the tiles changes with
zoom scale, so it is easy to see when it swaps to new tiles.
